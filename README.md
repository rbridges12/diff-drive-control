# Differential Drive Control

This repository contains code for control and simulation of a two-wheeled differential drive robot. Specifically, the aim is to drive the robot along a desired path in a minimal amount of time while staying near the path. Two control methods were implemented:
- **Direct Collocation** for simple trajectory optimization
- **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** for full feedback control

Full details and results can be found in our [report](https://github.com/rbridges12/diff-drive-control/blob/master/report.pdf). This project was completed as part of the course ROB 498: Applied Optimal Control at the University of Michigan.
